# Trivial spam classifier

This is a step-by-step guidance for a simple spam classifier using basic RNN with LSTM layers.

## Prerequisites 
You need to ensure you have the dataset available. I used Google Colab, mounted the drive, and used the valid path to the dataset .csv file `dataset_path` specified in the code.

This code is based on the [Parameswara rao](https://github.com/parameswaraRao-13) implementation of the spam email detection classifier.
