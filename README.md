# Trivial spam classifier

This is a step-by-step guidance for a simple spam classifier, first, using basic RNN with LSTM layers. And then, comparing it with a few alternative architectures that are commonly used in text classification tasks like spam detection.

## Prerequisites
You need to ensure you have the dataset available. I used Google Colab, mounted the drive, and used the valid path to the dataset .csv file `dataset_path` specified in the code.

## Acknowledgements

The dataset used is from [Email Spam Detection Dataset (classification)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/email-spam-detection-dataset-classification/).
